# MCNP master input files
Files in the archive directory were the original input files created by Seth Dustin. These just had the fuel as a block, surrounded by the cooling plates and welds. This model was limited to two cooling loops per plate. 

The current directory contains the cask designs used for the IGEM cask modeling and simulation. The fuel is modeled as an assembly (lattice) surrounded by a gas gap; air, He, etc. This increases the length, width of the cooling plates. This master file does not include material cards for used fuel and boron-loading. See the README in the current directory for how to use the files.
